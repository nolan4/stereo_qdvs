This code emulates IBM's algorith introduced in the paper titled "A Low Power, High Throughput, Fully Event-Based Stereo System" found here: https://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/files/us-aandreo/cvpr2018.pdf. For efficiency in software, this implementation does not directly simulate ring buffers, spiking neurons, or the quaternary thermometer code.
